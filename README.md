# Lissajous Curve Table

This is a project for recreating the Lissajous Curve Table. It is not operable with a GUI, you can start up the program see how he curves are created and you can exit from the fullscreen window using the 'Escape' key.

# About

So bassically, there is a table more precisely a matrix with curves and in the up and left part of the window you can see some circles that are actually sized according to the ratio of your screen size and the radius of a circle. There are some small points that are rotating on the circles. The first circle rotates with a certain speed, the second one 2 times faster, the third 3 times faster and so on. The idea s that if you play with the sin and cos values of the angle that the points are rotated by, you can get some intresting patterns.
